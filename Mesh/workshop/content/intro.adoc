## Purpose

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the
burden of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed
on the application developer, with different or non-existent support for
microservice concepts depending on language and framework.

The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure,
with features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability,
policy enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to
focus on business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply
some of these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running
on top of OpenShift Container Platform using OpenShift Service Mesh, an open
platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.

## Background

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh provides an easy way to create a network of
deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication,
monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in application code.
OpenShift can automatically inject a special sidecar proxy throughout your
environment to enable Service Mesh management for your application. This
proxy intercepts all network communication between your microservices, and is
configured and managed using Service Meshâ€™s control plane functionality --
not your application code!

Kiali is an observability console designed to provide operational insight
into the behavior and performance of the service mesh as a whole.

Jaeger is a utility for capturing distributed tracing information of requests
as they travel throughout the mesh.

Prometheus and Grafana are used to capture metrics about the performance and
behavior of the mesh.

These components combined together make up the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.

## Conventions
You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be executed directly while others will require modification,
of the command before execution. If you see a command block with a red border
(see below), the command will require slight modification.

[source,none,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
some command to modify
----

If you hover over the command block above and left-click, it should
automatically highlight all the text to make for easier copying.

Most command blocks support executing with a click. Which terminal the
command block executes in is pre-determined and will be indicated to you. For
example, command blocks with looping scripts will be executed in the lower
terminal like below:

[source,bash,role="execute-2"]
----
for i in 1 2 3; do echo "hello $i"; done
----

For non-terminating loops, you will have to click the lower terminal and then
press Ctrl+C to terminate the program. For example, try executing the next
code block:

[source,bash,role="execute-2"]
----
echo "A load generating script is running in the next step. Ctrl+C to stop"
while :;do echo "this won't print" &> /dev/null ; done
----

For ordinary commands, we will be using the upper terminal:

[source,bash,role="execute-1"]
----
echo "Hello World"
----

## Getting Started
The terminals are running in a container inside the same OpenShift cluster
where you will be using the service mesh. That container has many utilities
pre-installed, including the `oc` CLI. The Service Mesh control plane is
already deployed with several application components in an OpenShift
Container Platform 4 environment.

[source,bash,role="execute-1"]
----
oc version
----

When you logged in earlier with your credentials, this lab guide and its
terminals became logged in as you, too:

[source,bash,role="execute-1"]
----
oc whoami
----

You can access the OpenShift web console by clicking on word *Console* on the
toolbar above your terminal. To come back to the terminals, just click
*Terminal*.

## Before Continuing
While all of the exercises can stand alone and you can do them in any order,
most of them involve looking at the Kiali observability interface and/or
Jaeger's tracing interface. As such, please make sure to complete the
Observability with Kiali module first before continuing to any others. We do
not describe accessing Kiali or Jaeger anywhere else.
